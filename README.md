## Goal of the study: 
Our goal is to better understand features of early-life immunity

## Cohort information (scRNAseq):

We performed integrated single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 95 healthy individuals spanning 2 months to 88 years of age. <br/>
**scRNAseq dataset**: 27 infants, 23 children, 18 young and 27 older adults <br/>
**snATACseq dataset**: 8 infants, 4 children, 5 young and 6 older adults <br/>
